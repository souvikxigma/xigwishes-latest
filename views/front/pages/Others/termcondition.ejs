                                                        2.1. Account. In order to access the Service, Customer is required to register for an account by submitting the information requested in the applicable web form or interface (“Account“). In the event the Service Plan permits multiple users of the Service, an account may need to be set up for each such user (each, a “User Account“, and references herein to the “Account” shall be deemed to include all such User Accounts if applicable). Customer shall, in any event, be primarily responsible and liable for any users’ use of the Service and their compliance with this Agreement. Under the Account, Customer may be required to set up access credentials, and the Service may also allow Customer to configure different permission levels among various Service Plans. Customer represents and warrants, on behalf of itself and its users (if applicable), that all information submitted during the registration process is, and will thereafter remain, complete and accurate. As between xigwishes and Customer, Customer alone shall be responsible and liable for maintaining the confidentiality and security of its Account credentials, as well as for all activities that occur under or in such Account. Customer shall immediately notify xigwishes in writing of any unauthorized access to, or use of, an account, or any other breach of security. Furthermore, Customer must make each user aware of the provisions of this Agreement and the Privacy Policy, prior to authorizing such user to access the Service. The Privacy Policy is hereby incorporated into this Agreement by reference. 2.2. Subscription. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, xigwishes grants Customer a limited, non-exclusive, non-assignable, non-transferable, non-sublicensable right, during the Term (defined below), to access and use the Service solely for Customer’s internal purposes (collectively, the “Subscription“). The Subscription shall be subject to whatever other limitations or conditions (as such regarding Features, volume, duration, or location) are specified in the Service Plan. Use of the Service must be in accordance with the Documentation. 2.3. Storage Space. During the Term of this Agreement, xigwishes will provide and/or may offer Customer storage space (the “Storage Space”). The size of such Storage Space may be changed from time to time at xigwishes’s sole discretion and may be used by the Customer solely for the purposes of the Service. For the removal of any doubt, in the event of termination of this Agreement, for any reason, xigwishes shall delete the Customer Content from the Storage Space and such Customer Content shall no longer be available on or through the Service. 2.4. Free Trial. For each Subscription, xigwishes may offer a free trial period (if offered, the default period is seven (7) days, unless configured otherwise by xigwishes) (“Free Trial” and “Free Trial Period“) prior to charging for the Fees. The Free Trial, if any, shall commence on the date that Customer commences access or use of the Service, and will terminate at the end of the Free Trial Period, or sooner if: (a) Customer proceeds to begin paying the applicable Fees, (b) Customer requests to cancel the Subscription, or (c) the Free Trial is terminated by xigwishes, in its sole discretion. Upon termination of the Free Trial, and unless Customer has cancelled the Subscription or xigwishes has terminated the Free Trial, the Fees shall become immediately due and payable (and if no payment or billing information have been provided, Customer shall, and may be required, to provide such information). Free Trials are permitted solely for Customer to determine whether to proceed to a paid Subscription. Free Trials may not include all Features. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS AGREEMENT, xigwishes AND xigwishes AFFILIATES WILL HAVE NO WARRANTY, INDEMNITY, SUPPORT, OR OTHER OBLIGATIONS OR LIABILITIES WITH RESPECT TO FREE TRIALS, AND xigwishes HAS THE RIGHT TO TERMINATE A FREE TRIAL AT ANY TIME AND FOR ANY REASON. 2.5. Restrictions. As a condition to the Subscription, Customer shall not do (or permit or encourage to be done) any of the following (in whole or in part): (a) copy, “frame” or “mirror” the Service or xigwishes Content; (b) sell, assign, transfer, lease, rent, sublicense, or otherwise distribute or make available the Service or xigwishes Content to any third party (such as offering it as part of a time-sharing, outsourcing or service bureau environment); (c) publicly perform, display or communicate the Service or xigwishes Content; (d) modify, alter, adapt, arrange, or translate the Service or xigwishes Content; (e) decompile, disassemble, decrypt, reverse engineer, extract, or otherwise attempt to discover the source code or non-literal aspects (such as the underlying structure, sequence, organization, file formats, non-public APIs, ideas, or algorithms) of, the Service or xigwishes Content; (f) remove, alter, or conceal any copyright, trademark, patent, or other proprietary rights notices displayed on or in the Service or xigwishes Content; (g) circumvent, disable or otherwise interfere with security-related or technical features or protocols of the Service or xigwishes Content; (h) make a derivative work of the Service or xigwishes Content, or use them to develop any service or product that is the same as (or substantially similar to) it; (i) store or transmit any robot, malware, Trojan horse, spyware, or similar malicious item (for example, by way of Customer Content) intended (or that has the potential) to damage or disrupt the Service or xigwishes Content; (j) employ any hardware, software, device, or technique to pool connections, devices or users that directly access or use the Service or xigwishes Content (sometimes referred to as ‘virtualization’, ‘multiplexing’ or ‘pooling’) in order to circumvent any limitations or conditions on the scope of the Subscription; (k) forge or manipulate identifiers in order to disguise the origin of any data or content inputted or uploaded to, or transmitted through, the Service or xigwishes Content by Customer; or (l) take any action that imposes or may impose (as determined in xigwishes’s reasonable discretion) an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on the servers, network, bandwidth, or other cloud infrastructure which operate or support the Service or xigwishes Content, or otherwise systematically abuse or disrupt the integrity of such servers, network, bandwidth, or infrastructure. 2.6. Reservation of Rights. For the avoidance of doubt, the Service and xigwishes Content (including any copies thereof) are only licensed hereunder, and no title in or to the Service or xigwishes Content (or such copies) passes to Customer, even after installation on your personal computers, mobile handsets, tablets, and/or other devices (“Devices”) Any rights not expressly granted herein are hereby reserved by xigwishes and its licensors, and, except for the Subscription, Customer is granted no other right or license to the Service or xigwishes Content, whether by implied license, estoppel, exhaustion, operation of law, or otherwise. 2.7. Delivery. The Service will be delivered electronically. Unless specified otherwise in the Order Form, the Service shall be deemed accepted upon delivery. 2.8. Data Backup. The Service is not intended to, and will not, operate as a data storage or archiving product or service, and Customer agrees not to rely on the Service, and/or the Storage Space for any Customer Content whatsoever. Customer is solely responsible and liable for the maintenance and backup of all Customer Content.
                                                        3. UPDATES AND SUPPORT
                                                        3.1. Updates. All references herein to the “Service” shall include any Updates provided by or on behalf of xigwishes under this Agreement. xigwishes may from time to time provide Updates but shall not be under any obligation to do so. Such Updates will be supplied according to whatever then-current internal policies xigwishes may have in place, and some Updates may, in any event, be limited, suspended or restricted by geography, volume, duration or any other criteria decided by xigwishes in its sole discretion. Some Updates may include automatic updating or upgrading without any notice or obligation to Customer, and Customer consents to any such automatic updating or upgrading of the Service. In some cases, Customer may be required to install the Update manually. An Update may be accompanied by separate or additional terms and conditions, as well as additional fees (in each case, “Update Specific Terms“). Unless stated otherwise in Update Specific Terms, all Update Specific Terms apply in addition to (and not instead of) this Agreement. 3.2. Support. xigwishes (and/or a xigwishes Affiliate or subcontractor) will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Service-related technical support via any helpdesk or online portal offered via the Service and/or https://support.xigwishes.com. 3.3. The Service is developed by xigwishes or for xigwishes and is designed to enable the use of the Service through supported Devices; this software may vary by Device and medium and functionalities and features and offerings may also differ between Devices.
                                                        4. CUSTOMER CONTENT
                                                        As between Customer and xigwishes, Customer is solely responsible and liable for (and agrees to hold harmless and release xigwishes and all xigwishes Affiliates from) all Customer Content, xigwishes’s processing of Customer Content, for all use of Customer Content (including without limitation use by others), as well as for the consequences of inputting, uploading, or transmitting Customer Content (including without limitation, for obtaining any licenses, permissions, consents, approvals, and authorizations from individuals appearing therein). Customer hereby represents and warrants that: (a) its Customer Content does not, and will not, infringe, misappropriate, or violate any third party’s Intellectual Property Rights, privacy rights (or other personal rights), or any Law; (b) its Customer Content is not, and will not be, disparaging, libelous, threatening, offensive, harassing, deceptive, abusive, promoting of violence, illegal drugs, illegal arms trafficking, or illegal gambling, and does not, and will not, contain obscenity or pornography, create any risk to a person’s safety or health, impersonate another person, compromise national security, or interfere with an investigation by law enforcement; and (c) it has obtained, and will maintain during and after any termination of this Agreement, any and all licenses, permissions, consents, approvals, and authorizations required in connection with Customer Content. The content, nature, frequency, and quantity of Customer Content has not been specifically requested or authorized (and may or may not be reviewed) by xigwishes and is submitted to the Service at Customer’s sole risk and discretion. Unless specifically requested by the Service, or strictly required for use of the Service, Customer represents and warrants that Customer Content will not include any Sensitive Data (as defined below), unless Sensitive Data is specifically requested by the Service or xigwishes. “Sensitive Data” means any (i) categories of data enumerated in Article 9(1) of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation 2016/679, aka the GDPR) or any successor Law; (ii) patient, medical or other protected health information regulated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended and supplemented (“HIPAA“), and Customer also agrees that xigwishes is not acting as Customer’s Business Associate or subcontractor (as such terms are defined under HIPAA); (iii) credit, debit or other payment card data subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (“PCI DSS“); (iv) other information subject to regulation or protection under specific Laws, such as the United States’ Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (or related Laws); (v) social security numbers, national insurance numbers, driver’s license numbers or other government ID numbers; or (vi) any data similar to the foregoing that is protected under foreign or domestic Laws.
                                                        5. PAYMENT
                                                        5.1. Fees. Customer agrees to pay all fees stated in the Order Form and according to the Service Plan (“Fees“), and in accordance with the Service Plan’s applicable billing cycle (“Billing Cycle“) and other payment terms. 5.2. General. Unless expressly stated otherwise in the Order Form or Service Plan: (a) all Fees are stated, and are to be paid, in currency stated in the time of payment via credit or debit card, PayPal, in-app purchases made through the applicable app marketplace (i.e. Apple Appstore or Google Play) or any other payment method that shall offered by xigwishes from time to time (the “Payment Method”); (b) all Fees are payable in advance; (c) all payments under this Agreement are non-refundable and are without any right of set-off or cancellation, however xigwishes reserves the right to apply different refund policies from time to time on a case by case basis; and (d) any amount not paid when due will accrue interest on a daily basis until paid in full, at the lesser of the rate of one and a half percent (1.5%) per month and the highest amount permitted by applicable Law. Amounts payable under this Agreement are exclusive of all applicable sales, use, consumption, VAT, GST, and other taxes, duties or governmental charges, except for taxes based upon xigwishes’s net income. In the event that Customer is required by any Law applicable to it to withhold or deduct taxes for any payment under this Agreement, then the amounts due to xigwishes shall be increased by the amount necessary so that xigwishes receives and retains, free from liability for any deduction or withholding, an amount equal to the amount it would have received had Customer not made any such withholding or deduction. 5.3. Payment Method and Processing. Customer represents that it is the authorized user of the Payment Method. Customer shall provide xigwishes accurate and complete billing information and agrees to promptly notify xigwishes of any changes to the Customer’s billing information. For certain Payment Methods, there may be a temporary charge of $0.01 to verify the card’s validity (but this amount will be refunded as soon as the Payment Method is confirmed). Customer authorizes xigwishes (either directly or through third parties) to request and collect payment (and otherwise charge, refund or take any other billing actions) from Customer on a recurring basis, including without limitation via xigwishes’s payment provider or Customer’s designated banking account, and to make any inquiries xigwishes deems necessary to validate Customer’s designated Payment Method or financial information, in order to ensure prompt payment (including for the purpose of receiving updated payment details from Customer’s payment, credit card or banking account provider – such as, updated expiry date or card number as may be provided to xigwishes by Customer’s credit card company). Payment of Fees may be processed through a third-party payment processing service (which will receive and process Customer’s billing information), and additional terms may apply to such payments.
                                                        6. OWNERSHIP
                                                        6.1. Service. As between the parties, xigwishes is, and shall be, the sole and exclusive owner of all Intellectual Property Rights in and to (a) the Service; and (b) any and all improvements, derivative works, modifications, and/or customizations of/to the Service, regardless of inventorship or authorship. Customer shall make, and hereby irrevocably makes, all assignments necessary or reasonably requested by xigwishes to ensure and/or provide xigwishes the ownership rights set forth in the preceding sentence. 6.2. Customer Data. As between the parties, Customer is and shall be, the sole and exclusive owner of all Customer Content. 6.3. Feedback and Statistical Data. In the event that Customer (or any person on Customer’s behalf) provides any suggestions or similar feedback regarding the Service and/or xigwishes Content, or any part thereof (“Feedback“), and/or to the extent xigwishes receives de-identified statistical (or similar) information or data regarding Customer’s use of the Service and/or xigwishes Content (“Statistical Data“), xigwishes shall be entitled, in perpetuity, to use and commercially exploit such Feedback and Statistical Data without any obligation or restriction whatsoever.
                                                        7. THIRD PARTY SERVICES
                                                        The Services enable you to engage and procure certain third-party services, products, and tools for enhancing your overall user experience, including, without limitation, printing and shipping services (collectively, “Third Party Services”). You acknowledge and agree that regardless of the manner in which such Third Party Services may be offered to you, xigwishes merely acts as an intermediary platform between you and such Third Party Services, and does not in any way endorse any such Third Party Services, or shall be in any way responsible or liable with respect thereto. xigwishes will not in any way be responsible for monitoring, any interaction or transaction between you and any Third party Services. You acknowledge that such services may require the payment of additional amounts to xigwishes and/or to the providers of such Third-Party Services. Any and all use of such Third Party Services shall be done solely at your own risk and responsibility and may be subject to such legal and financial terms which govern such Third Party Services, which you are encouraged to review before engaging with them. While we hope to avoid such instances, xigwishes may, at any time and at its sole discretion, suspend, disable access to or remove from the Service any Third-Party Services –– without any liability to you or to any End Users.
                                                        8. CONFIDENTIALITY
                                                        Each party and/or its Affiliates (the “Recipient“) may have access to certain non-public or proprietary information and materials of the other party and/or its Affiliates (the “Discloser“), whether in tangible or intangible form (“Confidential Information“). Confidential Information shall not include information and material which: (a) at the time of disclosure by Discloser to Recipient hereunder, was in the public domain; (b) after disclosure by Discloser to Recipient hereunder, becomes part of the public domain through no fault of the Recipient; (c) was rightfully in the Recipient’s possession at the time of disclosure by the Discloser hereunder, and which is not subject to prior continuing obligations of confidentiality; (d) is rightfully disclosed to the Recipient by a third party having the lawful right to do so; or (e) independently developed by the Recipient without use of, or reliance upon, Confidential Information received from the Discloser. The Recipient shall not disclose the Discloser’s Confidential Information to any third party, except to its employees, advisers, agents and investors, subject to substantially similar written confidentiality undertakings. Recipient shall take commercially reasonable measures, at a level at least as protective as those taken to protect its own Confidential Information of like nature, to protect the Discloser’s Confidential Information within its possession or control, from disclosure to a third party. The Recipient shall use the Discloser’s Confidential Information solely for the purposes of performing under this Agreement. In the event that Recipient is required to disclose Confidential Information of the Discloser pursuant to any Law, regulation, or governmental or judicial order, the Recipient will (a) promptly notify Discloser in writing of such Law, regulation or order, (b) reasonably cooperate with Discloser in opposing such disclosure, (c) only disclose to the extent required by such Law, regulation or order (as the case may be). Upon termination of this Agreement, or otherwise upon reasonable written request by the Discloser, the Recipient shall promptly return to Discloser its Confidential Information (or if embodied electronically, permanently erase it, and if requested, certify such erasure in a signed writing).
                                                        9. DISCLAIMERS
                                                        THE SERVICE, xigwishes CONTENT, AND ALL OTHER SERVICES AND ITEMS PROVIDED OR MADE AVAILABLE BY xigwishes ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS, WITH ALL FAULTS, AND WITHOUT ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, GUARANTEE, OR CONDITION OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, QUIET POSSESSION, NON-INFRINGEMENT, TITLE, OR THAT OTHERWISE ARISE FROM A COURSE OF PERFORMANCE OR DEALING, OR USAGE OF TRADE, ALL OF WHICH ARE HEREBY DISCLAIMED BY xigwishes AND ITS LICENSORS; xigwishes DOES NOT MAKE ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, GUARANTEE, OR CONDITION REGARDING THE EFFECTIVENESS, USEFULNESS, RELIABILITY, COMPLETENESS, OR QUALITY OF THE SERVICE, xigwishes CONTENT, OR OTHER SERVICES AND ITEMS PROVIDED OR MADE AVAILABLE BY xigwishes, THAT CUSTOMER’S USE THEREOF WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE OR ERROR-FREE, OR REGARDING THE SATISFACTION OF, OR COMPLIANCE WITH, ANY GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS OR STANDARDS. The above disclaimers apply to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law. If Customer is a consumer under its applicable Law, Customer may have legal rights in its country of residence which would prohibit the above disclaimers from (fully or partially) applying to Customer (for example, some jurisdictions’ Laws do not allow the disclaimer of certain implied warranties or conditions, and do not allow limitations to be imposed on statutory rights), and, to the extent the above disclaimers are prohibited, then Customer and xigwishes agree that they will not apply to Customer.</p>
